☐ Make this a Google Chrome plugin
☐ Use screen.width, screen.height to get the size of the screen and then use top, left, width and height to put the new popup in the correct place with the correct size. You should be able to configure the plugin to select whether you want the popup in the left or right side of the screen too.
☐ You should be able to automatically get width, height and size of the popup automatically with a button that fills those fields by using the current values of the popup.
